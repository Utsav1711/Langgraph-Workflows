       " 'explanation': '**What the joke is doing**\\n\\n1. **Set‑up:**  \\n   *“Why did the mango bring a ladder to the party?”*  \\n   This makes us picture a mango (a fruit) behaving like a person and doing something odd—bringing a ladder. It primes us to look for a reason that will involve a play on words.\\n\\n2. **Punch‑line:**  \\n   *“Because it heard the punch‑line was going to be *a‑peel*ing and wanted to reach the ‘top’ of the jokes!”*  \\n\\n3. **How the wordplay works**\\n\\n| Element | Literal meaning | Pun / double meaning |\\n|---------|----------------|----------------------|\\n| **Mango** | A tropical fruit. | The joke treats the mango as a character that can think, hear, and act. |\\n| **Ladder** | A tool for climbing to a higher place. | In the joke the mango uses the ladder to “reach” something that’s metaphorically high—*the top of the jokes*. |\\n| **Punch‑line** | The final, funny part of a joke. | Here it’s also something the mango “heard about” beforehand, as if it were news. |\\n| **a‑peel‑ing** | Sounds like “appealing” (attractive, interesting). | The word is split into **a‑peel**, referencing the fruit’s skin (its *peel*). So the joke says the punch‑line will be “a‑peel‑ing” — both “appealing” and literally about a fruit’s peel. |\\n| **Top of the jokes** | The best or highest‑quality jokes. | Because the mango wants to be at the “top,” it brings a ladder to climb up—literally reaching a higher spot, and figuratively trying to be part of the best jokes. |\\n\\n4. **Why the ladder makes sense in the pun**  \\n   - **Literal level:** If a punch‑line is “a‑peel‑ing,” the mango might think it’s *physically* on a higher shelf (like a fruit display) that it needs a ladder to reach.  \\n   - **Figurative level:** “Reaching the top of the jokes” is a common expression for delivering the best humor. The mango’s ladder is a goofy visual way to show it’s trying to climb to that comedic peak.\\n\\n5. **The emoji 🍑**  \\n   The peach emoji is a visual cue that we’re in “fruit‑themed” territory. It also reinforces the playful, light‑hearted tone of the joke.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### TL;DR\\n\\n- The joke hinges on the word **“a‑peel‑ing”**, which sounds like “appealing” but also literally refers to a fruit’s peel.  \\n- Because the mango thinks the punch‑line will be *a‑peel‑ing* (i.e., a great, fruit‑related joke), it brings a ladder so it can **climb to the “top” of the jokes**—both the literal top (hence the ladder) and the figurative top (the best jokes).  \\n- The humor comes from treating a mango like a person, mixing fruit‑related wordplay with the visual gag of a ladder, and ending with a playful fruit emoji.'}"
